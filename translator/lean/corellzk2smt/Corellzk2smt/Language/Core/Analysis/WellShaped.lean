/- A program is "well-shaped" when:
   (a) at every `if`-statement it contains, *both* branches always succeed from any starting
       environment (run independently of one another and of `cond`'s actual value -- this is a
       hypothetical "would both branches typecheck" check, not a claim about the branch actually
       taken at runtime), and never disagree on a variable's shape (scalar vs. array, or array
       length) -- i.e. a variable is never a scalar coming out of one branch and an array (or a
       differently-sized array) coming out of the other. Phrased as an unconditional `∃`
       (guaranteeing success) rather than a conditional `∀ ... → ... → ...` (only constraining
       shape *if* both happen to succeed) so that `SymExec/PartialCorrectness/Correctness.lean`'s
       `seIfStmt_correct` can derive the *symbolic* shape-agreement fact it needs (for merging)
       from this one alone, instead of assuming it separately -- a conditional form can be
       vacuously true with no real content, which doesn't give anything to derive from;
   (b) [REMOVED 2026 -- see below] `loop_exp` used to additionally require its repetition count
       be a syntactic literal (`SimpleExpr.val`); that turned out to be unnecessary.
       `seCmd_correct`'s `.loop_exp` case no longer needs it: `tryEvalSimpleExprToFFValue`
       resolving `rep` to *some* value under `symEnv` already, together with
       `tryEvalSimpleExprToFFValue_correct` (`SymExec/Lemmas.lean` -- a `.const` symbolic binding
       forces the matching concrete env to hold exactly that value, via `EnvMatches`), gives
       everything needed to show the concrete side resolves `rep` to the *same* value, without
       assuming anything about `rep`'s syntax up front;
   (c) [REMOVED 2026 -- see below] `if`-statement conditions used to additionally require
       `evalCond` be defined on every concrete environment; also turned out to be unnecessary, for
       the same reason as (b): in `seIfStmt_correct`'s "condition doesn't constant-fold" branch,
       `encodeCond symEnv cond` succeeding is *already* forced by `seIfStmt`'s own success (it
       fails via `mergeIfBranches` whenever `encodeCond` does), so it can be extracted directly
       from the success hypothesis instead of assumed up front via `encodeCond_defined`; and
   (d) every `func_call` site names a function that actually exists in the (remaining) program,
       called with the right arity (`args`/`outs` lengths matching the callee's declared
       `params`/`rets`), and arguments that are always concretely defined *and* already
       shape-matched to the callee's declared param types (`ValuesMatchParams`) -- the call-site
       well-formedness `seFuncCall_correct` (`SymExec/FuncCallCorrectness.lean`) itself needs as
       hypotheses, now phrased once here so `H_funcCall` (`SymExec/Correctness.lean`) can be
       discharged from it instead of assumed unconditionally (see that file's `H_funcCall` design
       notes for why the unconditional form is never actually provable). `outs.Nodup` used to be
       part of this clause too, but turned out to be unnecessary: `EnvMatches_setVars`
       (`SymExec/FuncCallCorrectness.lean`) preserves `EnvMatches` across a repeated-`outs` call
       just fine, since both the concrete and symbolic `setVars` recurse over `outs` in the same
       left-to-right order and so resolve a repeat to "last write wins" identically on both
       sides -- no distinctness needed for that argument to go through.

   The language isn't strongly typed (see `DefinedVars.lean`), so this can't be checked by a
   static type system -- it's a semantic well-formedness precondition on the *program*,
   assumed rather than verified, exactly mirroring the precondition `mergeSymValue`
   (`SymExec/BigStep.lean`) already requires to merge two branches' values at all: shape
   disagreement makes merging undefined, not just unproven.

   This is checked structurally the same way `DefinedVarsCom`/`DefinedVarsCmds` are (mirroring
   their recursion shape one-for-one) -- it doesn't need to descend into a called function's own
   body (that's a separate, whole-program-level well-shapedness concern -- see
   `SymExec/FuncCorrectness.lean`'s whole-program correctness notes), only check the call *site*
   itself.

/-- A whole program is well-shaped: every function's body is `WellShapedCmds` against exactly the
    remainder `fetchFunc` would give it (i.e. every function-body's `p'` parameter throughout this
    program is really the tail *right after* that function -- matching `fetchFunc`'s own
    remainder semantics, since a function's own name being unique within the whole program
    (enforced by the second conjunct below) means `fetchFunc` on the whole list finds it right at
    the head), together with global function-name uniqueness (a function's name never recurs among
    the functions after it -- combined recursively, this gives uniqueness across the whole
    program). Needed so that `seExecFuncs_correct`'s `specs` accumulator can invoke
    `TranslatesCorrectly_prepend` at each step: a newly-added function's name is disjoint from
    every spec already built for the functions after it. -/
