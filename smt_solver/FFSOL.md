# FFSOL code

This includes only the source code of the part of the solver that works with the theory of finite field. This is all part of the Barcelogic SMT solver which is currently not open source, but is planed to make it open source along the execution of the AVAZAR project.

The code has been developed by Miguel Isabel, Enric Rodríguez-Carbonell, Clara Rodríguez-Nuñez and Albert Rubio. The purpose of making it available is just showing the current state of the code, but it has been added with a single commit which does not reflect the history of all commits made by the developers.

In the future all the code will be available with the correct history, which will include former developers of the Barcelogic SMT solver.
